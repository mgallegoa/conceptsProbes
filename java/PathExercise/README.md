# pathExercise
This project is a small exercise for study in Java, this exercise find the path given a collection of categories.


 ## Input is an _unordered_ collection of categories, where "id", "parentId", and "name" are pre-populated.
        Implement this method to print the full path for each category in the collection.
        
        For example, if category A is parent of category B and category B is parent of category C, then
              the path for category A is "A"
              the path for category B is "A > B"
              the path for category C is "A > B > C"
          where "A" is the name of category A
                "B" is the name of category B
                "C" is the name of category C
        
         Note: Number of categories in a specific path can be greater than 3 as provided in this example.
               Your solution should work with any number of parents (e.g. A > B > C > D > ... > X)
